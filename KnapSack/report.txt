Created an item object to be used as a container to hold the weight and value of the items that are read in.

The input is read in and assigned to capacity, the weight limit of the bag, and n, the number of items to be read in.
We then go into a while loop where the counter currline is incremented every iteration until currLine is greater than n.
Each line that is read in is assigned to (w) weight, and (v) value of the item. A item object is then declared and w and v are then passed in
to initialize the object. Then we push the item object back into the global items vector to be used later.
