HUFFMAN CODES, Developed by David Huffman

- technique to compress data and reduce its size without losing and information. 

STEPS

    1. calculate frequency of each character in the string
    2. Sort the characters in increasing order, by their frequency, Store these in a priority queue (Q)
    3. Make each unique character as a leaf node.
    4. Create an empty node (z). Assign the minimum frequency to the left child of z and assign the seconde minimum freq to the right child of (z).
    5. Set the value of z as the sum of the above minimum frequencies.
    6. Remove these twoo minimum frequencies from (Q) and add the sum into the list of frequencies.
    7. Insert node (z) into the tree.
    8. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for all characters.
    9. For each non-leaf node assign 0 to the left edge and 1 to the right edge.
