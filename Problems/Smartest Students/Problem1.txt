1) If we only have the restriction of total weight (W). Which algorithm
we learned in class can solve this problem?

    - We can use the Dynamic Programming approach, the same algorithm and Execution Recurrence Tree
    which solve the unlimited knapsack problem.
    - In the Knapsack problem, we are given a set of objects, the value and weight of each object, and
    the weight capacity of the knapsack. 
    - we are tasked with finding the maximum total value of a set of objects, 
    such that the sum of all selected object's weight does not exceed the weight capacity of the
    knapsack.

    - In short, An optimization problem where we want to maximize one value but have a given restriction.
    - This problem can be solved by usng an Execution Recurrence Tree data structure, as we did with the Knapsack problem
    - Where instead of 
        - objects we have students
        - values we have students IQ's (smart level)
    - similar to the knapsack problem we have given weights and weight capacity restriction.
