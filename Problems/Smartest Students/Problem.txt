Yihan is invited to take some of her students to a top international conference. She plans to select some
students from the CS141 class. There are N students who are interested in the conference. However, Yihan
only has a limited budget, and only a subset of students can be selected (well, sorry!). UCR decided to send
an airplane for Yihan and the students. There are T seats on the plane, and the plane can take at most
W lbs of passenger and luggage. Yihan knows the weight of each student with his/her luggage, noted as wi
for the i-th student. You can assume that Yihan drives the plane (she’s not good at driving planes though.
Watch out!) so she doesn’t count in the T seats, nor for the W-lb weight limit.
Yihan wants to let others know that UCR students are really good. Hence, she wants to take the smartest
students. In particular, we know the smartness of each student, noted as si for the i-th student. She wants
to know the highest total smartness she can achieve, by selecting no more than T students with weight
no more than W. The total smartness is the sum of the smartness of all selected students.
